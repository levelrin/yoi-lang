# Variable

Users can declare a variable like this:
```yoi
rin (user)
  name: "Rin"
  email: "levelrin@gmail.com"
```

The above is the same as the following variable in `Java`:
```java
final User rin = new User("Rin", "levelrin@gmail.com");
```

Here are some important points:
1. Users are not allowed to reassign the variable's value.
2. Users must specify the type of variable.
3. Users must specify the name of each parameter.
4. Indentation is significant, like `Python`. Users must use two spaces for each nest.
5. Users are allowed to use spaces to name their variables. However, consecutive spaces are not allowed.
6. Only lower-cased English characters, integers, and spaces are allowed for the variable's name.
